Welcome to the **Diabetes** project! This repository provides a full-stack solution for diabetes risk prediction using a machine learning model with a Flask backend and a modern, responsive frontend.

---

## 📖 Introduction

The **Diabetes** project empowers users to predict their risk of diabetes by submitting health data through a user-friendly web interface. The backend leverages a trained machine learning model to analyze the data and provide predictions instantly. This solution is ideal for educational purposes, prototyping, or as a foundation for health-related web applications.

## ✨ Features

- **Machine Learning Powered:** Uses a pre-trained model to predict diabetes risk.
- **RESTful API:** Flask-based backend for handling prediction requests.
- **Modern Frontend:** Responsive HTML/CSS for an intuitive user experience.
- **Cross-Origin Support:** Enabled via CORS for seamless frontend-backend integration.
- **Easy Deployment:** Simple setup and configuration.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ (for backend)
- Node.js & npm (optional, if you want to use more advanced frontend tooling)
- Flask, Flask-CORS, joblib, pandas, numpy (Python packages)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subikshapanner/Diabetes.git
cd Diabetes
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors joblib pandas numpy
   ```
3. Ensure `diabetes_model.joblib` and `scaler.joblib` are present in the backend folder.
4. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Open `frontend/index.html` directly in your web browser.
2. (Optional) Deploy with any static site hosting service or integrate with advanced tooling.
